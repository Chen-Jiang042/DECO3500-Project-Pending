# DECO3500-Project-Pending Green Tourism

Hi! We are Group Pending, welcome to our github, our documentations are all in the Wiki page (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki). Our prototype is divided into six parts over the course of this semester. 

## Part 1 The Proposal (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Part-1:-Proposal) :

This is the original design, including the description of domain and problem space, there are also have the purpose of our prototype and how will the future work be arranged? Our teammembers self-introductions are in the part either.

## Part 2 Research (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Interview,-result-and-initial-requirement) :

This part you will find the research and resource about our concept, we also iterate and perfect our domain and concept as full as possible.

## Part 3 First Design Iteration (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Low-fidelity-Prototype-Explanation) :

We made the inital prototype in this part, after the user testing, we made three personas and anaylze the feedback.

## Part 4 Second Design Iteration (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Middle-Fidelity-Prototype):

We have implemented most of the design, and this stage is still testing and analyzing users.


## Part 5 Showcase/prototype (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Functional-Prototype):

In this part, we have fully implemented our prototype and demonstrated it to others. We have received a lot of feedback. In the showcase, we will analyze the feedback and get the future development direction.


## Part 6 Document (https://github.com/Chen-Jiang042/DECO3500-Project-Pending/wiki/Appendix):

This part include the appendix and resources we used.
